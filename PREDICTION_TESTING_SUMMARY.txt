HR EMPLOYEE ATTRITION - PREDICTION TESTING SUMMARY
================================================================================

TASK 5: MODEL TESTING AND PREDICTION - COMPLETED ✓

Date: October 22, 2025
Script: model_prediction_testing.py

================================================================================
1. OVERVIEW
================================================================================

Successfully tested the trained Decision Tree Classification Model with:
• Existing test dataset (294 samples)
• 5 diverse hypothetical employee profiles
• Sensitivity analysis on key interventions
• Comprehensive business recommendations

Key Finding: Model predictions revealed severe overfitting and conservative
             behavior, confirming earlier observations from Tasks 3 and 4.

================================================================================
2. TEST DATASET ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Existing Test Set: 294 employees

PREDICTION DISTRIBUTION:
------------------------
• Predicted No Attrition: 248 (84.4%)
• Predicted Yes Attrition: 46 (15.6%)

ACTUAL DISTRIBUTION:
--------------------
• Actual No Attrition: 247 (84.0%)
• Actual Yes Attrition: 47 (16.0%)

CONFIDENCE ANALYSIS:
--------------------
• Mean Attrition Probability: 15.6%
• Median Probability: 0.0% (most predictions are 0%)
• High Confidence (>80%): 46 cases
• Low Confidence (<30%): 248 cases
• Uncertain (40-60%): 0 cases

ACCURACY BREAKDOWN:
-------------------
• Overall Accuracy: 76.53%
• High Confidence Correct: 12 cases
• High Confidence Wrong: 34 cases (⚠ PROBLEMATIC!)
• Model is overconfident in wrong predictions

KEY INSIGHT: Model shows extreme conservatism - predicts 0% probability
             for most cases, only triggering attrition prediction for
             very specific leaf node conditions.

4. PREDICTION RESULTS
================================================================================

⚠️ CRITICAL FINDING: ALL 5 PROFILES PREDICTED "NO ATTRITION" (0% PROBABILITY)

Profile 1 (Sarah - High Risk Design):
--------------------------------------
Prediction: NO - Will Stay
Attrition Probability: 0.0%
Risk Level: LOW
Decision Path: TotalWorkingYears > 2.50 → OverTime > 0.50 → MonthlyIncome <= 4001.50

Profile 2 (Michael - Stable):
------------------------------
Prediction: NO - Will Stay
Attrition Probability: 0.0%
Risk Level: LOW
Decision Path: TotalWorkingYears > 2.50 → OverTime <= 0.50 → NumCompaniesWorked <= 4.50

Profile 3 (Jessica - Moderate):
--------------------------------
Prediction: NO - Will Stay
Attrition Probability: 0.0%
Risk Level: LOW
Decision Path: TotalWorkingYears > 2.50 → OverTime > 0.50 → MonthlyIncome > 4001.50

Profile 4 (David - Recent Hire):
---------------------------------
Prediction: NO - Will Stay

----------------------------------
Prediction: NO - Will Stay
Attrition Probability: 0.0%
Risk Level: LOW
Decision Path: TotalWorkingYears > 2.50 → OverTime <= 0.50 → NumCompaniesWorked <= 4.50

================================================================================
5. MODEL BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS
================================================================================

WHAT THIS REVEALS:

1. EXTREME CONSERVATISM:
   • Model predicts 0% attrition for almost all cases
   • Only very specific leaf node conditions trigger attrition prediction
   • Even "high risk" profile (Sarah) predicted as 0% risk

2. OVERFITTING CONFIRMED:
   • Tree has learned very specific training examples
   • Poor generalization to new cases
   • 311 nodes with 156 leaves = overly complex
   • Many leaves have very few samples

3. LOW DISCRIMINATION:
   • Model cannot distinguish between risk levels
   • All profiles treated similarly
   • Explains poor recall (25.53%) on test set

4. DECISION LOGIC RIGID:
   • Primary split: TotalWorkingYears ≤ 2.50
   • Unless exactly matching training patterns, predicts retention
   • No nuanced risk assessment

WHY THIS HAPPENED:
------------------
• Unpruned tree (depth 15) learned noise
• Class imbalance (84% vs 16%) biased towards majority class
• No regularization applied
• Tree memorized specific training cases rather than patterns

IMPLICATIONS:
-------------
✗ Model NOT suitable for production use
✗ Cannot reliably identify at-risk employees
✗ Would miss most potential attritions
✗ Requires significant optimization/retraining

================================================================================
6. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS RESULTS
================================================================================

Tested 5 intervention scenarios on Profile 3 (Jessica):

Baseline:                           0.0% attrition probability
Salary increase (+20%):             0.0% (no change)
Eliminate overtime:                 0.0% (no change)
Increase tenure (+5 years):         0.0% (no change)
Improve all satisfaction scores:    0.0% (no change)
Combined interventions:             0.0% (no change)

FINDING: Model predictions are completely rigid. Interventions had ZERO
         impact because model only predicts attrition for very specific
         leaf node conditions that weren't met.

WHAT THIS MEANS:
----------------
• Model cannot assess incremental risk changes
• No sensitivity to important business levers
• Cannot be used for "what-if" scenario planning
• Reinforces need for model optimization

================================================================================
7. BUSINESS INSIGHTS (Despite Model Limitations)
================================================================================

Although the model's predictions were not useful, the analysis framework
provides valuable insights:

KEY LEARNINGS FROM PROCESS:
----------------------------

1. EARLY WARNING INDICATORS:
   • TotalWorkingYears < 2.5 years (root split confirms this is critical)
   • Overtime work (appears frequently in tree)
   • Low compensation
   • Poor satisfaction scores
   • Long commutes

2. RETENTION INTERVENTION PRIORITIES:
   • Eliminate unnecessary overtime (cost-effective)
   • Competitive compensation (market benchmarking)
   • Improve work-life balance
   • Focus on new employees (< 2.5 years)
   • Manager training on retention

3. ROI OF RETENTION:
   • Replacement cost: $75K-$165K per employee
   • Specialized roles: $150K-$300K
   • Retention investment: $15K-$30K for high risk
   • ROI: 5-10x

4. RISK SEGMENTATION FRAMEWORK:
   Low Risk (<30%): Maintain, standard programs
   Moderate (30-70%): Proactive interventions
   High (>70%): Urgent, comprehensive action

9. RECOMMENDATIONS BASED ON FINDINGS
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:

1. DO NOT DEPLOY CURRENT MODEL TO PRODUCTION
   • Model is not reliable
   • Will miss most attritions
   • Could lead to poor business decisions

2. IMPLEMENT MODEL OPTIMIZATION (URGENT):
   • Prune tree to depth 5-7
   • Set min_samples_split = 20
   • Set min_samples_leaf = 10
   • Retrain with constraints

3. ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES:
   • Random Forest (ensemble reduces overfitting)
   • XGBoost/LightGBM (better handling of imbalance)
   • Logistic Regression (simpler, more interpretable)
   • SMOTE for class imbalance

4. USE ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:
   • Framework is valuable even if model isn't
   • Retention strategies are sound
   • ROI calculations are realistic
   • Implementation roadmap is actionable

LONGER-TERM STRATEGY:

1. Retrain optimized model
2. Validate with cross-validation
3. Test on new hypothetical profiles
4. Deploy for quarterly risk assessment
5. Monitor and refine

================================================================================

   • Real-world profiles reveal limitations
   • Metrics alone don't tell full story

2. OVERFITTING HAS SEVERE CONSEQUENCES:
   • Perfect training accuracy is a red flag
   • Model must generalize, not memorize
   • Pruning/regularization is essential

3. CLASS IMBALANCE REQUIRES SPECIAL HANDLING:
   • 84/16 split biased model heavily
   • SMOTE or class weighting needed
   • Focus on minority class metrics

4. BUSINESS CONTEXT MATTERS:
   • Even failed model provides insights
   • Process is valuable
   • Framework can outlive specific model

5. ITERATIVE DEVELOPMENT ESSENTIAL:
   • First model rarely perfect
   • Testing reveals issues
   • Refinement is part of process
